As an international user
I want to recieve your product

*background*
Our business is growing and we now need to print off address information around the world. It has come to the attention of the product that the UK format for address labels is not valid for all countries. 

We want to start shipping to the US, Hong Kong, Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany and Japan

We already have collected the Address information but require a change to display the correct Address. 

Examples:

Italy

US

Switzerland

Hong Kong

France

Germany

Japan
